nnor.co is my personal site. It includes a public copy of my resume and transcript, as well as an overview of some of my projects and some othe miscellaneous info.

At present, it is configured to be hosted on the Heroku platform (https://www.heroku.com/) using the Harp static webserver (https://harpjs.com/).
I don't know why you'd want to deploy your own instance, but it is simple to do simply by creating a new Heroku project and using this repository as the source.
