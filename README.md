My personal site

Includes a public copy of my resume and transcript, as well as an overview of some of my projects and some othe miscellaneous info.

At present, it is configured to be hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) with [Harp](https://harpjs.com/).

I don't know why you'd want to deploy your own instance, but it's simple to do - just create a new Heroku project with this repository as the source.
