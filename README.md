Includes a public resume, transcript, and project overview.

Currently configured for [Harp](https://harpjs.com/) on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). I don't know why you'd want to deploy your own instance, but it's simple to do - just create a new Heroku project with this repository as the source.
